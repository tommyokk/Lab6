To start, we will generate a random integer between 1 and 20, and 
based on the result of the random number, we check to see if it falls under a certain range
if the number is greater than 15, then the result will be "Cherries"
otherwise if the number is > 10, then the result will be "Orange"
otherwise if the number is > 5, then the result will be "Plum"
otherwise if the number is > 2, then the result will be "Melon"
otherwise if the number is > 1, then the result will be "Bell"
if the number is not any above, then the result will be "Bar"

we iterate over using a loop three times and print the results to the user. As an example "Plum Cherries Melon"
